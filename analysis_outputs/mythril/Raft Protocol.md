# Raft Protocol - Security Analysis (Trace + Mythril)

# Security Incident Analysis Report

## Attack Overview
This report analyzes a suspected rugpull attack targeting a token contract. The attacker deployed a contract, transferred tokens to it, and then systematically drained liquidity and tokens. The analysis focuses on identifying the exploited contract and the attack sequence.

## Contract Identification
- Attacker Contract: `0xc1f2b71A502B551a65Eee9C96318aFdD5fd439fA` - This contract is the primary actor in the attack, initiating deployments, token transfers, and interactions with other contracts. It's not the victim.
- Victim Contract: `0x9AB6b21cDF116f611110b048987E58894786C244` - The Mythril report identifies this contract as having numerous integer overflow vulnerabilities and dependence on predictable environment variables. The attacker interacts with this contract, suggesting it is the target.
- Helper Contracts: Several contracts are created by the attacker during the attack:
    - `0xfdc0feaa3f0830aa2756d943c6d7d39f1d587110`
    - `0x67ffc92eda90e744c45864b0bd70acf1738ff780`
    - `0x30481c87e3f221e1689126f92a4df9f890c6ade5`
    - `0x9a2b82c00bc281fabe23f5b720f0883cf14ebe94`

    - `0x6f9c91218f29a69e31168beed0c987e22d88cfa4`
    - `0x44f8b3b0fb808150f014d8f319b15acee3d61ff3`
    - `0xba1afff81bf736b04b8e863d95f5e3bdc3fb3380`
    - `0xe16e1c106fa2d19f993f3928bdee06e5eac6f520`
    - `0x011992114806e2c3770df73fa0d19884215db85f`

## Vulnerability Analysis
The Mythril report highlights numerous SWC-101 (Integer Overflow/Underflow) vulnerabilities in the victim contract `0x9AB6b21cDF116f611110b048987E58894786C244`. These vulnerabilities exist across multiple functions, including core token functionalities like `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `increaseAllowance`, and `decreaseAllowance`.

Examples from the Mythril report:

```

The presence of these vulnerabilities in standard token functions suggests a deliberate design flaw, enabling the attacker to manipulate token balances and allowances.

## Exploitation Mechanism

The attack appears to follow a rugpull pattern, leveraging the identified integer overflow vulnerabilities. Here's a reconstruction based on the transaction data:

1. **Contract Deployment:** The attacker deploys the exploit contract `0xc1f2b71A502B551a65Eee9C96318aFdD5fd439fA` in transaction `0xb5bf9e2e13aadb921b06202d4c9dab146fb015b77ff7e292c8d80a378802c56f`. This contract likely contains the logic to exploit the vulnerabilities in the victim contract.
2. **Initial Token Transfers:** The attacker transfers tokens (likely from the victim contract) to the exploit contract. This is evidenced by transactions like `0x123977da00f673bb6d7caa1074e6c44f1f24eb7eef69b7f3148d8d97d6a9ab1c`, `0x67fc36e98eba005f7673480e10493a55080617e4bcfb123b6f4542e541e1a6f2`, `0x8ba6492caad6fd1a0bbf185c2feae69b265b6fd54de2e57da39aec8c0f9173ae`, `0xee8bd139223be6eb447c962795a6463cdec71a81261830890952c4c2ff8f2a28`, `0xf9101f3044900c188713508ab5f4069897b6ad2ea35dde00248a025a098d3bcf`, `0x617f176fd9c7ba1fdd684cbb2b420fc372ed997a02e24c337764d0d2c0234b08`, `0x2a15e623ed24455dbd7143168b63ec9c1c4c0ce102a7cf4b4e8e6850b27e0854`. The value transfers to `0x5fae7e604fc3e24fd43a72867cebac94c65b404a` suggest this address is controlled by the attacker and is used to accumulate the stolen funds.
3. **Exploiting Integer Overflows:** The attacker likely uses the integer overflow vulnerabilities to mint tokens or bypass transfer restrictions. The Mythril report points to numerous functions where these overflows can occur, enabling the attacker to manipulate balances and allowances.
4. **Draining Liquidity:** After inflating the token supply or gaining control over a significant portion of it, the attacker drains liquidity pools.  This is suggested by the numerous calls to functions with unclear purpose, potentially manipulating the token's internal state to facilitate the drain.
5. **Token Transfers to Exchanges:** There is no direct evidence of transfers to exchanges in the provided data. However, the accumulation of tokens in the attacker-controlled address `0x5fae7e604fc3e24fd43a72867cebac94c65b404a` strongly suggests the attacker's intent to liquidate the stolen tokens, potentially through exchanges.
6. **Contract Creation Spree:** The attacker creates numerous contracts (`0xfdc0feaa3f0830aa2756d943c6d7d39f1d587110`, `0x67ffc92eda90e744c45864b0bd70acf1738ff780`, etc.). These contracts are likely used as intermediaries to obfuscate the flow of funds and complicate tracing.

## Rugpull Detection

The evidence strongly suggests a rugpull attack:

- **Deployment and Token Transfer:** The attacker deploys a contract and transfers tokens to it, indicating control over the token supply.
- **Integer Overflow Vulnerabilities:** The presence of numerous integer overflow vulnerabilities in core token functions points to a deliberate design flaw enabling manipulation of token balances and allowances.
- **Draining Liquidity:** The systematic transfer of tokens and creation of helper contracts suggests an intent to drain liquidity pools.
- **Lack of Legitimate Activity:** There is no evidence of legitimate project development or community engagement. The transactions primarily involve token transfers and contract deployments controlled by the attacker.

## Conclusion

Based on the transaction trace and Mythril analysis, this incident is highly likely a rugpull attack. The attacker deployed a contract with exploitable integer overflow vulnerabilities, transferred tokens to it, and then systematically drained liquidity and tokens, indicating a malicious intent to defraud investors.
