# Abattoir of Zir (DIABLO) - Security Analysis (Trace + Mythril)

# Security Incident Analysis Report

## Attack Overview
The provided data suggests a potential exploit targeting the `multicall` function in contract `0x1a59BE240aA89685145967322dfAb3EBA7e574dB`. The attacker, `0x1bA6969b6236bFA500aB18cb6810b2A8C1Fbf2Df`, repeatedly calls this function. The Mythril report indicates potential integer overflow vulnerabilities within the contract, specifically in the `name()` and `symbol()` functions, or potentially in a function called `link_classic_internal(uint64,int64)`. The final transaction shows a transfer of value to `0x4649F62750775220f33E0376a3CceB82f69f9527`, suggesting a possible drain of funds.

## Contract Identification
- Attacker Contract: `0x1bA6969b6236bFA500aB18cb6810b2A8C1Fbf2Df` - This address initiates all the `multicall` transactions and the final value transfer, indicating its role as the attacker's contract.
- Victim Contract: `0x1a59BE240aA89685145967322dfAb3EBA7e574dB` - This contract is the target of the repeated `multicall` function calls. The Mythril report identifies potential integer overflow vulnerabilities within this contract. This suggests that the attacker is attempting to exploit these vulnerabilities through the `multicall` function.
- Helper Contracts: None identified in the provided data.

## Vulnerability Analysis
The Mythril report highlights potential integer overflow vulnerabilities (SWC-101) within the victim contract `0x1a59BE240aA89685145967322dfAb3EBA7e574dB`. The specific vulnerable functions are `name()`, `symbol()`, or potentially `link_classic_internal(uint64,int64)`.

Since the contract code is not provided, we can only speculate on the exact location of the vulnerability. However, the Mythril report suggests that arithmetic operations within these functions are susceptible to overflow or underflow.

## Exploitation Mechanism
The attacker repeatedly calls the `multicall` function of the victim contract. The `multicall` function likely allows the execution of multiple function calls within a single transaction. This is evident from the function signature `multicall(bytes32[],uint256)`. The `bytes32[]` likely represents an array of function selectors and encoded parameters, while the `uint256` parameter might represent a limit or flag.

The attacker is likely using the `multicall` function to trigger the integer overflow vulnerabilities identified by Mythril in `name()`, `symbol()`, or `link_classic_internal(uint64,int64)`. By carefully crafting the input data for the `multicall` function, the attacker can cause an integer overflow or underflow, potentially leading to unintended consequences such as:

1.  **Incorrect Token Balances:** An overflow in a balance calculation could allow the attacker to mint or steal tokens.
2.  **Bypassing Security Checks:** An overflow in a security check could allow the attacker to bypass restrictions and perform unauthorized actions.
3.  **Arbitrary State Modification:** In severe cases, an integer overflow could lead to arbitrary state modification, allowing the attacker to completely control the contract.

The final transaction, `0x77bb2f85d3f99b3baacef5f46443d8c690fb499fbf3acf7f9184db29bf45e101`, shows a transfer of `397120686327484667` wei from the attacker's contract to `0x4649F62750775220f33E0376a3CceB82f69f9527`. This suggests that the attacker successfully exploited the vulnerability and drained funds from the victim contract.

**Rugpull Detection:**

While the data is limited, the final transfer of funds away from the attacker's contract suggests a potential rugpull. The repeated calls to `multicall` followed by a large transfer of value is a common pattern in rugpull attacks. Without the contract code, it's impossible to definitively confirm if this is a rugpull. However, the evidence suggests that the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the victim contract to drain funds.
