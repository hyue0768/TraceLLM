# Peapods Finance - Security Analysis (Trace + Mythril)

# Security Incident Analysis Report

## Attack Overview
This report analyzes a potential exploit targeting contract `0xdbB20A979a92ccCcE15229e41c9B082D5b5d7E31`. The attack appears to involve triggering assertion violations and potentially exploiting integer overflow vulnerabilities within the contract. The `start()` function call in the transaction trace suggests the attacker is initiating some process within their own contract (`0x928B2DAe97FC5d40Cb0552815fb5ab071103e20a`) that interacts with the victim contract.

## Contract Identification
- Attacker Contract: `0x928B2DAe97FC5d40Cb0552815fb5ab071103e20a`. This contract initiates the transaction with function `start()`. Its purpose is to interact with the victim contract to trigger the exploit.
- Victim Contract: `0xdbB20A979a92ccCcE15229e41c9B082D5b5d7E31`. This is identified as the victim because the Mythril analysis highlights several vulnerabilities within this contract, including integer overflows and assertion violations. The attacker's transaction likely triggers these vulnerabilities.
- Helper Contracts: None identified from the provided data.

## Vulnerability Analysis
The Mythril analysis reveals several potential vulnerabilities in the victim contract `0xdbB20A979a92ccCcE15229e41c9B082D5b5d7E31`:

1. **Integer Overflow (SWC-101):**
   - Location: `name()` function, PC address 2955.
   - Location: `link_classic_internal(uint64,int64)` or `symbol()` function, PC address 5178.
   - Description: The arithmetic operations within these functions are susceptible to integer overflows. This could lead to unexpected behavior and potentially allow the attacker to manipulate the contract's state.

2. **Assertion Violations (SWC-110):**
   - Location: `_function_0xee9c79da`, PC addresses 7595, 16038, and 16066.
   - Description: The contract contains `assert()` statements that can be triggered by specific inputs. While `assert()` statements are intended for internal invariant checks, triggering them can halt execution and potentially disrupt the contract's functionality. The multiple locations suggest a pattern of input validation issues.

Without the source code, it's impossible to provide the exact vulnerable code segments. However, the Mythril analysis provides the function names and PC addresses where the vulnerabilities are located.

## Exploitation Mechanism
The transaction trace shows a call to the attacker contract's `start()` function. This function likely contains logic to interact with the victim contract and trigger the identified vulnerabilities.

The Mythril analysis highlights the `_function_0xee9c79da` function in the victim contract as a source of assertion violations. The attacker's contract likely calls this function with specific inputs designed to trigger the assertions. The data field `0xee9c79da` is the function selector, and the subsequent bytes are the function arguments. The different PC addresses for the assertion violations suggest that different input values can trigger the assertions.

The integer overflow vulnerabilities in `name()` and `link_classic_internal()` or `symbol()` could be exploited to manipulate internal state variables, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control over the contract's assets. However, without the source code, it's difficult to determine the exact impact of these overflows.

The high gas used (`896664`) in the transaction suggests that the `start()` function call in the attacker contract triggers a complex series of operations within the victim contract, likely related to the exploitation of the identified vulnerabilities.

## Rugpull Detection
Based on the provided information, there is no definitive evidence of a rugpull. However, the identified vulnerabilities and the attacker's ability to trigger assertion violations raise concerns. The attacker could potentially exploit the integer overflows to manipulate token balances or other critical contract state, effectively draining the contract's assets. The assertion violations could be used to disrupt the contract's functionality and prevent users from accessing their funds.

Further investigation is needed to determine the full extent of the attacker's capabilities and whether they are attempting to execute a rugpull. Analyzing the victim contract's source code and monitoring the attacker's subsequent transactions are crucial steps in this process.
