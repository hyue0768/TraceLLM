## Attack Overview

This report identifies a potential rugpull attack targeting users who deposited funds into the `d90e2f925DA726b50C4Ed8D0Fb90Ad053324F31b` contract. The attacker, `0x81F48A87Ec44208c691f870b9d400D9c13111e2E`, deployed a contract `0x9776C0ABE8aE3C9Ca958875128F1ae1D5afafCb8` and then used it to interact with the victim contract. The attacker deposited funds into the victim contract and then, in the final transaction, withdrew a smaller amount to a different address, potentially indicating a loss of funds for other depositors.

## Contract Identification

- Attacker Contract: `0x81F48A87Ec44208c691f870b9d400D9c13111e2E` - This address initiated all transactions related to the potential exploit, including contract creation and deposits.
- Victim Contract: `0xd90e2f925DA726b50C4Ed8D0Fb90Ad053324F31b` - This contract receives multiple deposits from the attacker. The traces of the deposit transactions show calls to `0x47ce0c6ed5b0ce3d3a51fdb1c52dc66a7c3c2936`, which suggests that `d90e2f925DA726b50C4Ed8D0Fb90Ad053324F31b` is a deposit contract that interacts with another contract (`0x47ce0c6ed5b0ce3d3a51fdb1c52dc66a7c3c2936`). The final transaction shows a deposit that routes to `0x12d66f87a04a9e220743712ce6d9bb1b5616b8fc`, indicating a potential change in the underlying logic or destination of funds.
- Helper Contracts: `0x9776C0ABE8aE3C9Ca958875128F1ae1D5afafCb8` - This contract was created by the attacker and appears to be an intermediary contract used to interact with the victim contract. The trace of transaction `0xd20b3b31a682322eb0698ecd67a6d8a040ccea653ba429ec73e3584fa176ff2b` shows that this contract receives 20 ETH from WETH (`0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2`) and then creates a series of contracts and sends 20 ETH to WETH from each of them. This is highly suspicious and suggests the attacker is using this contract to obfuscate the flow of funds.

## Vulnerability Analysis

Without the source code of the victim contract (`0xd90e2f925DA726b50C4Ed8D0Fb90Ad053324F31b`) and the contract it interacts with (`0x47ce0c6ed5b0ce3d3a51fdb1c52dc66a7c3c2936`), it's impossible to definitively identify the vulnerability. However, the observed behavior suggests a potential rugpull scenario.

Possible vulnerabilities could include:

*   **Centralized Control:** The contract owner (potentially the attacker) may have the ability to withdraw deposited funds, change the destination of funds, or manipulate the accounting of deposits.
*   **Lack of Slippage Protection:** If the contract interacts with a decentralized exchange (DEX), a lack of slippage protection could allow the attacker to manipulate the price and drain funds.
*   **Reentrancy:** A reentrancy vulnerability could allow the attacker to recursively call the deposit function and drain funds before the contract can update its state.

## Exploitation Mechanism

The attack appears to follow these steps:

1.  **Contract Deployment:** The attacker deploys a contract `0x9776C0ABE8aE3C9Ca958875128F1ae1D5afafCb8` (Transaction `0x5b415454528128f12a699582a45254bd8554085247e1e8fcaa2893c77e83140d`).
2.  **Funding the Helper Contract:** The attacker funds the helper contract `0x9776C0ABE8aE3C9Ca958875128F1ae1D5afafCb8` with 20 ETH from WETH (Transaction `0xd20b3b31a682322eb0698ecd67a6d8a040ccea653ba429ec73e3584fa176ff2b`). This transaction also involves the creation of multiple contracts and the transfer of 20 ETH to WETH from each of them, which is highly suspicious.
3.  **Deposits into Victim Contract:** The attacker deposits 1 ETH in each of transactions `0x977587cf8437fe9c8fb10c27a1fb77eb0117246ea66ed8a3872f172dbe07bc02`, `0xe4777b8d72ac861f032c5e4fc8dab2561f8e75c9e58d00dc56797f188a2e54b4`, `0x90531cef5092af4500581d9f96bc061af89f74fa9d3f0d565dbd6311e022400f`, `0xd642f33e07c301703b8f2eda3e2be17297c78cc1f45e2b49b4c649105ffb879d`, `0x00a197bca9a40451199a8d1a64acce1f5e41a8e04ca0de853818cf82edd72262`, `0x1cda32d71a863c16679d8bd453ae3d66dcd172547ce2ff118327d74dd1dd11b8`, `0x1274f8b846163b81fe59eecd2c772e38106b9f54a28640c2521dd5d6d408402e`, `0x481f7dd521af48bc237f4f81f586746bb1254afbff36015f6eb5ba609896162b`, `0xbb32dd1047120374288d50655d4780cfdad592e312407311d171f287c0c9f054` into the victim contract `0xd90e2f925DA726b50C4Ed8D0Fb90Ad053324F31b`.
4.  **Potential Fund Diversion:** The final transaction `0xf30fecc85de6a35cefd43d7cdd58bf1605c4f395523f64c2e8ce40d00cb8a056` deposits only 0.1 ETH, and the trace shows that the funds are routed to `0x12d66f87a04a9e220743712ce6d9bb1b5616b8fc` instead of `0x47ce0c6ed5b0ce3d3a51fdb1c52dc66a7c3c2936`. This change in destination, coupled with the smaller deposit amount, suggests a potential diversion of funds.

**Rugpull Detection:**

The evidence strongly suggests a potential rugpull:

*   **Suspicious Helper Contract:** The creation and funding of the helper contract `0x9776C0ABE8aE3C9Ca958875128F1ae1D5afafCb8` with the unusual creation of multiple contracts and WETH transfers is a red flag.
*   **Change in Deposit Destination:** The final transaction diverts funds to a different address, indicating a potential change in the contract's logic or a deliberate attempt to siphon off funds.
*   **Deposits Before Potential Withdrawal:** The attacker deposits a significant amount of funds before potentially withdrawing or diverting them, which is a common tactic in rugpulls.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the available transaction data and traces, this incident appears to be a rugpull attempt. The attacker deployed a contract, deposited funds into a victim contract, and then potentially diverted funds to a different address. Further investigation, including analysis of the victim contract's source code, is necessary to confirm the vulnerability and the extent of the damage.
