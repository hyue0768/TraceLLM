# Conic Finance_1 - Security Analysis (Trace + Mythril)

# Security Incident Analysis Report

## Attack Overview
This report analyzes a potential rugpull attack targeting users of a smart contract at address `0x369cBC5C6f139B1132D3B91B87241B37Fc5B971f`. The analysis focuses on identifying the victim contract, the vulnerability exploited, and the attack sequence. The Mythril report indicates multiple integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities within the contract, which could be exploited for malicious purposes.

## Contract Identification
- Attacker Contract: `0x486cb3f61771Ed5483691dd65f4186DA9e37c68e` - This address receives approval and value transfers from `0xB6369F59fc24117B16742c9dfe064894d03B3B80`. It appears to be an externally owned account (EOA) controlled by the attacker, used to receive the stolen funds.
- Victim Contract: `0x369cBC5C6f139B1132D3B91B87241B37Fc5B971f` - This contract is identified as the victim based on the Mythril analysis, which flags multiple high-severity integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities. The traces also show that `0xB6369F59fc24117B16742c9dfe064894d03B3B80` interacts with this contract and then sends funds to the attacker's EOA.
- Helper Contracts: `0xB6369F59fc24117B16742c9dfe064894d03B3B80` - This contract interacts with the victim contract and sends funds to the attacker's EOA. It is likely a contract deployed by the attacker to facilitate the exploit.

## Vulnerability Analysis
The Mythril report highlights several integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities (SWC-101) within the victim contract `0x369cBC5C6f139B1132D3B91B87241B37Fc5B971f`. The report points to multiple functions where these vulnerabilities exist. For example, the following functions are flagged:

- `_function_0xc70920bc`
- `_function_0xe17e1725`
- `_function_0xcb03a464`
- `_function_0x83645abf`
- `_function_0x331666fa`
- `_function_0x24a71a66`
- `_function_0x86fe9a66`

The specific code segments where these overflows/underflows occur are not provided in the report, but the report indicates the program counter (PC) addresses where the vulnerabilities are located. These vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate token balances or other critical contract state by causing arithmetic operations to wrap around.

## Exploitation Mechanism
Based on the provided data, the exploitation mechanism appears to involve the following steps:

1. **Approval:** The contract `0xB6369F59fc24117B16742c9dfe064894d03B3B80` calls the `approve()` function (transaction `0xc8603387e50e659d128790b827627911b039e986f221eda9124f1e263f2093a0`) on a token contract (likely the victim contract or a related token contract), granting the attacker's EOA (`0x486cb3f61771Ed5483691dd65f4186DA9e37c68e`) permission to transfer tokens.

2. **Exploitation:** The contract `0xB6369F59fc24117B16742c9dfe064894d03B3B80` interacts with the victim contract `0x369cBC5C6f139B1132D3B91B87241B37Fc5B971f` (transactions `0x37acd17a80a5f95728459bfea85cb2e1f64b4c75cf4a4c8dcb61964e26860882` and `0x8478a9567b06d5b9a2e09a0599a95c674cf2d9a70496e6ef7e5f0f3d0ec9a0ef`). The specific function called is unknown, but the input data `0x4c741db9` suggests a custom function. This interaction likely triggers the integer overflow/underflow vulnerability, allowing the attacker to manipulate balances or other state variables.

3. **Transfer:** The attacker's EOA (`0x486cb3f61771Ed5483691dd65f4186DA9e37c68e`) receives a large value transfer of `11562597740138712507` from `0x7f86bf177dd4f3494b841a37e810a34dd56c829b` (transaction `0x37acd17a80a5f95728459bfea85cb2e1f64b4c75cf4a4c8dcb61964e26860882`). This transfer likely represents the stolen tokens.

4. **Further Transfer:** The attacker's EOA (`0x486cb3f61771Ed5483691dd65f4186DA9e37c68e`) then transfers the same value `11562597740138712507` to `0xB6369F59fc24117B16742c9dfe064894d03B3B80` (transaction `0x37acd17a80a5f95728459bfea85cb2e1f64b4c75cf4a4c8dcb61964e26860882`). This is suspicious and could be part of the exploit logic, potentially re-entering the victim contract or manipulating balances further.

**Rugpull Detection:**

Based on the analysis, the following signs suggest a potential rugpull:

- **Vulnerable Contract:** The victim contract has multiple high-severity integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities, which could be intentionally introduced.
- **Suspicious Transfers:** The attacker's EOA receives a large transfer of tokens, indicating a potential drain of funds from the victim contract.
- **Helper Contract:** The use of a helper contract (`0xB6369F59fc24117B16742c9dfe064894d03B3B80`) to interact with the victim contract and transfer funds to the attacker's EOA is a common tactic in rugpulls.
- **Approval then Drain:** The attacker first approves the transfer, then drains the funds.

**Conclusion:**

The provided data suggests a potential rugpull attack exploiting integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities in the victim contract `0x369cBC5C6f139B1132D3B91B87241B37Fc5B971f`. The attacker used a helper contract to interact with the victim contract, manipulate balances, and transfer a significant amount of tokens to their EOA. Further investigation is needed to confirm the exact code segments exploited and the full extent of the damage.
