# Fake Memecoin (MEME) - Security Analysis (Trace + Slither)

# Security Incident Analysis Report

## Attack Overview
This report analyzes a potential rugpull attack targeting a memecoin contract. The analysis focuses on identifying the exploited contract, the vulnerability leveraged, and the sequence of events leading to the potential loss of value for token holders. The attacker contract is `0x3417D4Fa067806f8F70C2A692548048962B7aC45`.

## Contract Identification
- Attacker Contract: `0x3417D4Fa067806f8F70C2A692548048962B7aC45` - This address is the contract that receives the majority of calls in the provided transaction data. It also contains the function `renounceOwnership()`, `workMyDirefulOwner(uint256,uint256)` and `_SIMONdotBLACK_(int8[],int224[],int256,int64,uint248[])`, which are suspicious. Slither analysis identifies this as the Memecoin contract.
- Victim Contract: Based on the transaction data and the Slither analysis, the contract `0x3417D4Fa067806f8F70C2A692548048962B7aC45` is the victim contract. It is a malicious memecoin contract designed to facilitate a rugpull. The primary evidence for this is the presence of a suspicious function `_SIMONdotBLACK_` and the `workMyDirefulOwner` function, combined with the owner renouncing ownership shortly after deployment.
- Helper Contracts: There are no helper contracts.

## Vulnerability Analysis
The primary vulnerability lies within the `_SIMONdotBLACK_` function. The function's purpose is unclear and its name is highly suspicious, suggesting a potential backdoor. The function takes several array and integer inputs, which could be manipulated to alter the contract's state in an unintended way.

```solidity
    function _SIMONdotBLACK_(int8[] memory a,int224[] memory b,int256 c,int64 d,uint248[] memory e) public  {
        xaskak = (10 ** 18 * (78800 + 100) * (33300000000 + 800));
        if(longinfo[_msgSender()] == false) {
            longinfo[_msgSender()] = true;
        }
    }
```
The `workMyDirefulOwner` function is also suspicious. It takes two uint256 inputs and its purpose is unclear. The name suggests it is intended to be used by the owner to perform some privileged action.

```solidity
    function workMyDirefulOwner(uint256 a,uint256 b) public   {
        if(msg.sender == LLAXadmin){
            _balances[address(0)] += a + b;
        }
    }
```

The Slither analysis highlights several issues:

*   **Misuse of Boolean Constants:** The `symbol` function improperly uses boolean constants, which is a code smell.
*   **Shadowing:** The `owner` variable is shadowed in several functions, which can lead to confusion and potential errors.
*   **Missing Zero-Address Validation:** The constructor lacks a zero-check on the `hkadmin` address, which could allow the admin to be set to the zero address, effectively locking the contract.
*   **Boolean Equality:** The `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions compare to a boolean constant, which is unnecessary and can be simplified.
*   **Dead Code:** The `_msgData` function is never used and should be removed.
*   **Incorrect Solidity Version:** The version constraint `^0.8.0` contains known severe issues.
*   **Naming Conventions:** The `LLAXadmin` variable is not in mixedCase.
*   **Too Many Digits:** The constructor uses literals with too many digits, which can lead to overflow errors.
*   **State Variables That Could Be Declared Constant/Immutable:** The `xaskak`, `LLAXadmin` and `_totalSupply` variables should be constant or immutable.

## Exploitation Mechanism
The attack appears to be a planned rugpull, executed as follows:

1.  **Contract Deployment:** The attacker deploys the Memecoin contract (`0x3417D4Fa067806f8F70C2A692548048962B7aC45`).
2.  **Renounce Ownership:** The original owner (`0xBC0DD7FB34765C418c2A07706606b6A37D911288`) renounces ownership of the contract in transaction `0xac096a00a46b39124f0fffdf3df07e7a855ee7aeb0610891764b354d4e06926f`. This is a common tactic in rugpulls to create a false sense of security by implying that the contract is decentralized and immutable.
3.  **Call to `workMyDirefulOwner`:** The original owner calls the `workMyDirefulOwner` function in transaction `0x38e3f1a50adecc40fb995323dc33fceabf23d19941794f9d26918aac98a6b8a7`. This function adds the input values to the balance of the zero address, effectively minting new tokens.
4.  **Multiple Calls to `_SIMONdotBLACK_`:** Several addresses call the `_SIMONdotBLACK_` function. The purpose of these calls is unclear, but they could be used to manipulate the contract's state or to whitelist certain addresses.
5.  **Calls to `totalSupply` and `symbol`:** Several addresses call the `totalSupply` and `symbol` functions. These calls are likely made by users who are trying to verify the contract's information.

The combination of renouncing ownership, minting tokens, and the presence of a suspicious function like `_SIMONdotBLACK_` strongly suggests a rugpull. The attacker likely used the `workMyDirefulOwner` function to mint a large number of tokens, which they then sold on the market, driving down the price and leaving other token holders with worthless tokens.

## Conclusion
Based on the transaction data and the Slither analysis, the Memecoin contract (`0x3417D4Fa067806f8F70C2A692548048962B7aC45`) is a malicious contract designed to facilitate a rugpull. The attacker used the `workMyDirefulOwner` function to mint tokens and the `_SIMONdotBLACK_` function to manipulate the contract's state. The renouncing of ownership was likely a tactic to create a false sense of security.
