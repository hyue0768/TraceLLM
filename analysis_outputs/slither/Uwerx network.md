# Uwerx network - Security Analysis (Trace + Slither)

# Security Incident Analysis Report

## Attack Overview
This report analyzes a potential rugpull attack targeting the Uwerx token contract (`0x4306B12F8e824cE1fa9604BbD88f2AD4f0FE3c54`). The attacker contract (`0xDA2CCfC4557BA55eAda3cBEbd0AEFfCf97Fc14CA`) received a large amount of ETH from the WETH contract and then transferred a similar amount of Uwerx tokens back to the original sender of the transaction, `0x6057A831D43c395198A10cf2d7d6D6A063B1fCe4`. The transactions suggest a possible exploit related to the token's transfer or minting mechanism, potentially enabling the attacker to drain liquidity.

## Contract Identification
- Attacker Contract: `0xDA2CCfC4557BA55eAda3cBEbd0AEFfCf97Fc14CA`
    - This address received funds from the WETH contract, indicating it's likely the attacker's controlled contract. The attacker contract then sends the same amount of tokens back to the original transaction sender.
- Victim Contract: `0x4306B12F8e824cE1fa9604BbD88f2AD4f0FE3c54` (Uwerx)
    - The Slither report identifies this contract as an ERC20 token. The transaction trace shows that the attacker contract interacts with this contract.
- Helper Contracts: `0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2` (WETH)
    - The WETH contract is used to transfer ETH to the attacker contract.

## Vulnerability Analysis
Based on the transaction trace and the Slither report, the vulnerability likely lies within the Uwerx token contract (`0x4306B12F8e824cE1fa9604BbD88f2AD4f0FE3c54`). The trace shows a transfer of a large amount of ETH to the attacker, followed by a transfer of a similar amount of Uwerx tokens back to the original sender. This suggests a potential vulnerability related to the token's transfer or minting mechanism.

The Slither report highlights several potential issues:

1. **Missing Zero-Address Check:** The `setUniswapPoolAddress` and `setMarketingWallet` functions lack zero-address checks. While not directly related to the observed behavior, this could be used for future attacks.
    ```solidity
    function setUniswapPoolAddress(address _uniswapPoolAddress) public onlyOwner {
        uniswapPoolAddress = _uniswapPoolAddress;
    }

    function setMarketingWallet(address _marketingWalletAddress) public onlyOwner {
        marketingWalletAddress = _marketingWalletAddress;
    }
    ```

2. **Shadowing:** Multiple functions shadow the `owner` variable from the `Ownable` contract. While not a direct vulnerability, it can lead to confusion and potential errors.

Without the source code for the attacker contract and more detailed transaction traces (specifically, the internal calls within the Uwerx contract during the `0x54698b1e30efdf5cd958475e7603dc24bc50a39e077ccaa23b6c4ec707e7bbda` transaction), it's difficult to pinpoint the exact vulnerability. However, the observed behavior strongly suggests a potential exploit related to the token's transfer or minting mechanism, potentially enabling the attacker to drain liquidity.

## Exploitation Mechanism

1. **Funding the Attacker:** The attacker contract (`0xDA2CCfC4557BA55eAda3cBEbd0AEFfCf97Fc14CA`) receives a large amount of ETH (174786100489116297833 wei) from the WETH contract (`0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2`) in transaction `0x3b19e152943f31fe0830b67315ddc89be9a066dc89174256e17bc8c2d35b5af8`.
2. **Token Transfer:** The attacker contract then transfers a similar amount of Uwerx tokens back to the original sender of the transaction, `0x6057A831D43c395198A10cf2d7d6D6A063B1fCe4`, in transaction `0x54698b1e30efdf5cd958475e7603dc24bc50a39e077ccaa23b6c4ec707e7bbda`. The `input` field of this transaction is `0x31eb34a4`, which corresponds to the function signature for `transfer(address,uint256)`.

This sequence of events suggests that the attacker may have exploited a vulnerability in the Uwerx token contract to mint or acquire a large amount of tokens, which they then transferred back to the original sender, possibly in exchange for the initial ETH. This could be a rugpull scenario where the attacker drained liquidity from a pool after acquiring a large amount of tokens.

**RUGPULL DETECTION:**

Based on the analysis, there are strong indicators of a potential rugpull:

- **Large ETH Transfer to Attacker:** The attacker receives a significant amount of ETH from the WETH contract.
- **Suspicious Token Transfer:** The attacker then transfers a similar amount of Uwerx tokens back to the original sender.
- **Potential Minting Vulnerability:** The attacker may have exploited a vulnerability to mint a large amount of tokens.
- **Lack of Transparency:** The absence of verified source code for the attacker contract and the Uwerx contract makes it difficult to determine the exact exploitation mechanism.

Further investigation is required to confirm the rugpull and identify the specific vulnerability exploited. This includes analyzing the Uwerx contract's code for potential minting vulnerabilities, backdoor functions, or other malicious code.
